							<h2>Tailor</h2>
							</header>
								<p>In Indian cities ‘ready-to-wear’ is a relatively new phenomenon and for the middle classes getting tailor-made garments is cheaper than purchasing branded goods. Like the shopping malls (that came almost a decade ago), which are not as utilised as the local neighbourhood shops and stalls for groceries, local tailors are still the popular choice for new garments and alterations.</p>
